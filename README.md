# Marching-Cubes
The project draws the marching cubes with given list of float values and a threshold value. The data file given is a .dat file. 
The core of the project is the program which reads the float values(8000) from the file and processing the values and mapping them to a 3 
dimensional vertices of 20*20*20.
The figure drawn is dependent on the value of threshold.
